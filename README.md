A basic chess engine coded in python, with a GUI that allows you to use other stronger chess engines as Bots.


# Why Krevetka?
The name "Krevetka" means üç§"shrimp"ü¶ê in russian. The use of a marine animal is in the spirit of great engines such as Stockfish, Rybka.

# About the "image recognition":
The software takes a screenshot, and will search pixel by pixel the colors of the chessboard. After that, the program will know where is the chessboard on the screen(make sure it is fully visible), and will start to play. The program will see for the two squares with a modified color(that means a piece was moved) and will deduce what was the las move. This also means that you can change the pieces if you want, the size of the chessboard, but not the colors.

# The algorithm:
The minimax algorithm is an algorithm that will explore all the positions with a given depth. It uses a recursive function that will evaluate each position and will find the best one.
Krevetka uses this algorithm, with a depth of 3 at maximun. I didn't do the algorithm in its recursive version, but only with some "for" loops(faster in python than the recursive function).

# Folders:
-engines:
The other chess engines that you can use(you must put ONLY the executable files). Actually, there is only the free version of Komodo(here: https://komodochess.com/downloads.htm). For sure, you can also add other chess engines, like Stockfish on https://stockfishchess.org/download/(I didn't add it because the file was larger than 25MB).

-images:
The rgb values of the "yellow" squares on each website.

-polyglot:
The different polyglot chess opening books found here: https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/35448/looking-for-polyglot-opening-books?adlt=strict&toWww=1&redig=95BF7929665C40C0966EB2870AA78E90

# Files:
-krevetka.py:
The code of the chess engine.

-main.py:
The file with the GUI.

-endgame.mp3:
Actually, this is the song "hard as steel" from abbynoise, a Non Copyright Song(NCS). You can play it when the game is finished.

-tools.py:
This file will provide all the "tools" to analyze the screen. It will take screenshots, find the position, and will move the mouse to play.

-README.md:
The file that you are currently reading.

# Lichess account:
‚ö†WARNING‚ö†: NOTE THAT ANYONE USING THIS BOT FOR CHEATING WILL BE BANNED(quiet logic I think). EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE USING IT WITH A LICHESS BOT ACCOUNT, YOU MUST KNOW THAT THIS BOT DOES NOT USE THE LICHESS API, AND FOR THAT REASON THIS BOT WILL BREAK THE TERMS OF SERVICE OF LICHESS.
(note that I am working on the implementation of the lichess API, so be patient)
PS: note also that using bots on online chess platforms is considered as cheating.

# Run it!
run this command in the cmd: pip install -r requirements.txt

You must run the main.py file, if you want to play with the GUI(You can play without AI in the command just by running the krevetka.py file). I will also recommend to run it with the python interpreter pypy(here üëâ https://www.pypy.org/), dividing by two the waiting time(maximum 60s without, vs 30s with)).


(PS: There is a lot of code that is redundant and there are tons of improvements that can be made.)
